🔐 Python Password Strength Analyzer 🔐


A robust command-line tool built to evaluate password strength against modern security criteria. This project serves as a practical exploration of cyber hygiene and secure credential practices.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this task was to develop a functional password analyzer to gain a hands-on understanding of what constitutes a strong, secure password. The script provides instant feedback, rating passwords as Weak, Medium, or Strong, and offers specific, actionable advice for improvement. This helps to illustrate why password policies are a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity.

✨ Features
Multi-Criteria Analysis: Checks for length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Intuitive Scoring System: Assigns a score based on complexity to provide a clear strength rating.

Actionable Feedback: Instantly tells the user exactly what is missing from their password.

Interactive CLI: A simple and user-friendly command-line interface for easy testing.

📊 Demonstration Results
The tool was tested with several passwords of varying complexity to demonstrate its analysis capabilities. The screenshot below shows the live output as the tool evaluates weak, medium, and strong passwords, providing instant feedback for each.

The full set of test screenshots is available in the screenshots/ directory.


💡 Key Concepts & Learnings
Password Entropy: This project clearly shows that entropy (a measure of randomness and complexity) is crucial. Adding character variety and length makes a password exponentially more resistant to brute-force and dictionary attacks.

The Human Factor: Simple, predictable passwords are the weakest link in security. This tool helps visualize why user education on creating strong credentials is so important.

Input Validation: The script is a practical example of input validation, a core concept where user-provided data is checked against a set of rules to ensure it meets security and quality standards.
